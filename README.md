# Welcome to `eggheadio-course-notes`

This repository is a community garden lead by the eggheadio team and [Learner Advocates](https://howtoegghead.com/advocate).

With eggheadio-course-notes, you gain further resources to enrich your learning experience on [egghead.io](http://egghead.io/).
You are encouraged to leverage the notes when taking an egghead course, share, iterate, and contribute to them.

# Getting Started

Each folder follows the course slug. Inside each folder, you can find one or more of the following resources:

- `Notes`
- `Exercises`
  - `Community solutions`
- `Illustrations`
- `Sketches`
- `Images`

# Contribution

Learner Advocates create the initial set of notes. Once created, anyone from the community can contribute to the collection of notes.

- One set of notes per course
- If a course has already been covered, feel free to submit additions.

## Contributions we are looking for

We are looking for notes that explore holes in the material, fill in gaps, expand with alternative ideas, question the answers given, and give us a stronger sense of depth and understanding.

**This can take several forms.** Including, progressive summarization, sketch notes, illustrations, notes on deprecations, links to additional resources, and code examples.

## Submitting a contribution
