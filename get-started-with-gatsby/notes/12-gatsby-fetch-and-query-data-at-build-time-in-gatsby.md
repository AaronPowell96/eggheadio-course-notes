# Fetch and query data at build time in Gatsby

It's common to query data from a remote API to use inside of Gatsby at build time.

In this example, we have some data stored in Contentful that matches the structure of our hardcoded JSON.

## Add the `gatsby-source-graphql` Plugin

Install the plugin by running:

```
npm install gatsby-source-graphql
```

Next, we'll add and configure the plugin inside of `gatsby-config.js`.

Full configuration docs can be found on [Gatsby's plugin page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-graphql/), but to match the course we will configure it for Contentful.

Add an object to the `plugins` array with a `resolve` key of `'gatsby-source-graphql'`, and some options to connect to Contentful.

In order to let Gatsby use our API key, we'll import the `dotenv` package at the top of the file, and configure it to have a path.

```js
//gatsby-config.js
require('dotenv').config({
  path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
})

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-postcss',
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
      options: {
        typeName: `Contentful`,
        fieldName: `contentful`,
        url: `https://contentful-url-here.com`,
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.UR_SECRET_TOKEN}`,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Update `gatsby-node.js`

Inside of `gatsby-node.js` we need to update a few things.

To start, we can remove the hardcoded JSON data.

First, we'll destructure `graphql` from the parameters to our `createPages` function, as well as add the `async` keyword.

```js
exports.createPages = async ({ actions, graphql }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  const PokemonTemplate = path.resolve('.src/templates/pokemon.js')
  // ...
}
```

Now we will write our GraphQL query.
We want to query the `contentful` source from our `fieldName` in `gatsby-config.js`, then from our `pokemonCollection` we will look at `items` to get our `slug` and `name`.

We will create a `results` variable that `awaits` our query from calling GraphQL:

```js
const result = await graphql(`
  {
    contentful {
      pokemonCollection {
        items {
          slug
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
`)
```

We also need to update our `forEach` to iterate over `result.contentful.pokemonCollection.items` instead of our hardcoded JSON data:

```js
result.data.contentful.pokemonCollection.items.forEach(pokemon => ...)
```

When we refresh the server, we can click our Pokemon links as expected.
