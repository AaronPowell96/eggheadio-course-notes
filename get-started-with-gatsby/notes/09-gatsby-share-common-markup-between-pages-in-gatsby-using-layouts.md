# Share common markup between pages in Gatsby using Layouts

In the [Create-React-App version](https://codesandbox.io/s/optimistic-jepsen-1zqmb?from-embed=&file=/src/index.js) of our app, the Navigation is present in every page. However, it's missing when we navigate around our Gatsby version.

We can fix this by using a Layout component.

## Creating the Layout Component in Gatsby

Create a `components` directory at `/src/components` and a new file `layout.js`.

Inside of the new file, we'll import React, and define a `Layout` component.

Copy and paste the Navigation out of the `index.js` page into our new Layout component. We'll also bring over our Link and auth-related imports.

We'll render the `children` below the navigation.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import { logout, isLoggedIn } from '../services/auth'

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Gatsby Pokedex!</h1>
      ...content from index.js
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Updating `pages/index.js`

With the Navigation information added to our new `<Layout>` component, we can remove everything except for our `<h2>Main App</h2>`.

We'll import our new `Layout` component and wrap it around the h2.

```js
// pages/index.js

import React from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

const Main = () => {
  ;<Layout>
    <h2>Main App</h2>
  </Layout>
}

export default Main
```

Follow the same process for the `About` page and the Main Pokemon page.
