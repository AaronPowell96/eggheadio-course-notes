## Pressable components

There are many options for wrapping components that should be pressable. The main ones are `<Button />`, `<TouchableOpacity />`, `<TouchableWithoutFeedback />`, `<TouchableHighlight />` and `<Pressable />`. There are varying levels of customizability with each option, however, the React docs now recommend to use the `<Pressable />` component for attaching press handlers to any components, unless you have a really good reason not to.

## New components

[`<Button />`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button) - very basic component for making something pressable. Not very customizable. The React Native docs recommend using `<Pressable />` for all pressable components.

[`<TouchableOpacity />`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchableopacity) - used for wrapping components that should be pressable. The React Native docs recommend using `<Pressable />` for all pressable components.

[`<TouchableWithoutFeedback />`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablewithoutfeedback) - should be avoided unless necessary. Does not provide visual feedback which is helpful for accessibility. The React Native docs recommend using `<Pressable />` for all pressable components.

[`<TouchableHighlight />`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablehighlight) - used to wrap components that should be pressable. The React Native docs recommend using `<Pressable />` for all pressable components.

[`<Pressable />`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) - the recommended component that should be used to wrap any other components that should be pressable.
